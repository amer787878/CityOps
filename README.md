# CityOps â€“ Smart City Issue Reporting

CityOps helps residents report city problems (potholes, broken lights, missed garbage) and lets staff triage & fix them. Planned features include AI-based classification (type + priority), maps for exact location, community votes/comments, and a staff dashboard.

**Stack:** React, Node.js/Express, MongoDB (Socket.IO, OpenAI GPT, Google Maps planned)
